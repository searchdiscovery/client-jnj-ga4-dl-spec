# Survey Error

Fire whenever a user unsuccessfully completes a survey. 

This is in contrast to [`complete_survey`](survey/complete_survey.md) which occurs when a submission succeeds.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'survey_error',
  event_data: {
    error_message: '<error_message>',
    identifier: '<identifier>',
    name: '<name>',
    type: '<type>'
  }
});
```
